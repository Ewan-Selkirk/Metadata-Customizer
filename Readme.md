# Metadata Customizer
Metadata Customizer is a Spicetify extension that allows you to customize how much track/album metadata is visible. 

## Why?
It's always annoyed the hell out of me that Spotify doesn't show when a track or album was released (unless you hover over the release year for like 3 seconds). Originally was meant to just change that one thing but apparently I don't know when to stop.

## Requirements

 - Spotify Desktop Client (Not from the Windows store if on Windows)
 - [Spicetify-cli](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli)

## How to Install

 1. Follow [this guide](https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started/installation) for instructions on how to install Spicetify for your platform, including the ['Basic Usage'](https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started/basic-usage) page.
 2. Run `spicetify path` to find where you Spicetify home folder is. This should contain  the folders `CustomApps & Themes`, and you may have to create an`Extensions` folder yourself.
 3. Drop the `metadataCustomizer.js` file into the `Extensions` folder.
 4. Run `spicetify config extensions metadataCustomizer.js` to enable the extension.
 5. Run `spicetify apply` to apply the changes and restart Spotify.
